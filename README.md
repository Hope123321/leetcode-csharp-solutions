# LeetCode Daily Progress (C# Version)

This repo tracks my daily LeetCode problem-solving journey using **C#**, aiming to become an Algorithm Engineer and land a job at an international company in 6 months.

## 🗓 Schedule
I solve **2 problems per day**, documenting each solution with:
- ✅ Problem link & metadata
- 🧠 Approach description
- ⏱ Time Complexity
- 🧠 Space Complexity

---

### ✅ Day 1
- [x] [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) — Easy — HashMap
- [x] [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/) — Easy — Greedy
- [x] [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) — Easy — Hash Table
- [x] [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) — Easy — HashSet
- [x] [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) — Medium — Sliding Window
